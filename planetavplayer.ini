# name: Name of the feed (defaults to the title found in the feed)
#
# Additionally any other option placed here will be available in
# the template (prefixed with channel_ for the Items loop).  We use
# this trick to make the faces work -- this isn't something Planet
# "natively" knows about.  Look at fancy-examples/index.html.tmpl
# for the flip-side of this.
